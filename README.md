## üéÆ About My Game

Where did I get the idea for this game? I took a deep dive into the world of the crypto community and noticed the most important phrase of all crypto enthusiasts: **"To the moon!"** Every self-respecting person, when buying something (be it a meme coin, NFT, altcoin, BTC, etc.), always thinks "to the moon" as they update the chart every 5 minutes. This is the core, the base, the foundation.

That's why I present to you a game where the main goal is to fly upwards, *just like a Sonic token after the release of the mainnet*. However, every asset can't just fly upwards, it faces obstacles like FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt), panic, bad news in the real world. I brought this into the game in the form of space objects that try to knock down the player, and you need to dodge and fly around them.

but..

I didn't want to make a simple game and just give up on it after the Game Jam.

First, I decided to research the market and saw a very interesting [article](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/new-blockchain-based-content-opportunities-google-play.html) about Google allowing blockchain integration in Google Play games. This is my chance! To become the first developer of a Sonic SVM game on Google Play! This was my main motivation during development, it was the reason to do something cool, something working, and exciting. This will be my motivation to complete the project to the end.

I also won't hide the fact that I got my first pang of curiosity when I accidentally noticed this Hackathon with huge $$$ rewards. In fact, I have been dreaming of creating my own game all my life, maybe it's just a childhood dream, because I never finished the job and constantly gave up halfway due to certain life circumstances. However, this event, in my opinion, is my destiny. And Sonic SVM is my opportunity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Anchor Program Information

The backend is powered by an Anchor program written in Rust, which handles player registration, gameplay attempts, score recording, and NFT minting.

### Smart Contract Snippet

```rust
...
...
...
// Purchase an upgrade by transferring tokens from the user to the project owner.
pub fn buy_upgrade(ctx: Context<BuyUpgrade>) -> Result<()> {
    let leaderboard = &mut ctx.accounts.leaderboard;
    let player_pubkey = ctx.accounts.player.key();
    let player = leaderboard.players.iter_mut().find(|p| p.pubkey == player_pubkey)
        .ok_or(OrbitV2Errors::PlayerNotFound)?;

    if player.upgrades >= 24 {
        return Err(OrbitV2Errors::MaxUpgradesReached.into());
    }
    if ctx.accounts.user_token_account.amount < UPGRADE_COST {
        return Err(OrbitV2Errors::InsufficientTokens.into());
    }

    transfer(
        CpiContext::new(
            ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
            Transfer {
                from: ctx.accounts.user_token_account.to_account_info(),
                to: ctx.accounts.project_owner_token_account.to_account_info(),
                authority: ctx.accounts.player.to_account_info(),
            },
        ),
        UPGRADE_COST,
    )?;

    player.upgrades += 1;
    Ok(())
}
